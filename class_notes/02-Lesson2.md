### Git & Github concepts

* https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/Git.html
* Ask any questions you might have regarding git and/or Github throughout the course

### Basic Python

* https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/BasicPython.html
* In-place assignments for mutable and immutable types: https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/BasicPython.html#in-place-assignment
  * Are `a += [4, 5, 6]` and `a = a + [4, 5, 6]` the same? Find out with iPython (after `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = a`).
  * See an article like [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inplace-vs-standard-operators-python/)
* Multiple assignments, one-line swap in Python
